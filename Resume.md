I'm a practice-oriented electrical engineer who bridges the gap between mechanical design and intelligent software. My expertise spans the entire process chain: from CAD design and the practical production of prototypes (3D printing, soldering, assembly) to high-level programming of robotic applications (robotics, AI, TwinCAT, Python, C++). This rare combination of hardware expertise and software depth enables me to develop holistic and robust automation systems from the ground up.

* Participation in the project planning of a plastic plasma curing robot-automated system for process acceleration  
* Participation in the development of a robot-automated welding system for Airbus aircraft  
* Development of a hand-held control device for KUKA robots: Design and development of a comprehensive control system and motion algorithms in ROS2 for intuitive manual control of the robot. Responsible for the complete integration of relevant sensors and actuators as well as the development of the necessary interfaces to ensure responsive and precise control (RoboFlex).  
* Development of a 3D robotic milling machine for wood: Implementation of the higher-level control system to automate the entire milling process. Development of a robust data exchange algorithm that ensures seamless, real-time communication between the KUKA robot, a downstream PLC, a central database, and an external app, thus enabling a seamless digital production process (Woodbot).
